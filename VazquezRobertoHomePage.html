		   <p>GTA 6 is the most anticipated game of this decade. <span class="boldtext">Officially</span> coming in the
		   summer of 2025, it’s set to be an imitation of Miami, Florida, or as we gamers
		   know it “Vice City” from previous games. We know this information because the
		   release of the Official GTA 6 trailer was posted by <span class="boldtext">Rockstar Games</span> earlier this
		   week. We are going to be covering the trailer here to take all the noteworthy 
		   features on display. As more details come to the surface, we will be on it, making
		   sure our community is constantly getting updated on what's to come. We will share 
		   everything we know and update our game guides.</p>
           <p> This is our official <span class="boldtext">MW3 </span> review. We recommend all to try it for yourself
		   but for now, know our thoughts on multiplayer and zombie’s review. MW3 is fun
		   to play with the return of classic maps like <span class="italictext">Rust, Afghan, Highrise,</span> and my
		   personal favorite <span class="italictext">Wasteland.</span> Just imagine the same maps from 2009 just completely
		   remastered to adapt today’s technology. Add to this the return of cool features
		   like slide cancel, addition of horizontal ziplines, drivable train, Big Game Bounty,
		   and a Fly Buy Special Event.

		   <p> Once again GTA 6 has officially been announced with the release coming in summer of 2025.
		   So far, we don’t know too much but be ready to delete some of your games since GTA 6 is
		   supposed to take 400GB of space on your console. In the trailer we learn the name of one
		   of the protagonists of the game <span class="boldtext italictext">Lucia</span> and her partner
		   whose name is still unknown, they
		   are shown pulling off robberies and escaping the cops together. GTA 6 looks like it will
		   follow the storyline of Lucia and her unnamed partner as they try to get the biggest
		   robbery of their lives. Other than that, we are not too sure if we can control Lucia 
		   and her partner, but for now, we know a lot more about Lucia. Hopefully, we can indeed 
		   have two playable characters. If you have not yet watched the trailer, please go ahead 
		   to the <span class="boldtext">link below</span> and do so and let me know your opinions.
